# Descriptive-analysis-of-demographic-data

Earlier demography research had suggested that no country in the world had life ex-
pectancy of more than 40 years, almost all of the world was relatively poor with little to
no medical knowledge which had caused people to die younger with high child mortality
and low life expectancy (Max Roser and Ritchie, 2013). Child mortality rate is the death
of children under the age of 5 per 1,000 live births and also a metric for life expectancy
as a large number of children’s death means a number of the population not living to
old age, thereby reducing the lifespan (Roser et al., 2013).

Due to industrial revolution, new technology, research in medical ﬁeld, increase in wealth,
birth of contraceptive techniques, new abortion laws, education, e.t.c child mortality had
reduce all over the world (Roser et al., 2013) with increasing life expectancy. A data set
containing life expectancy at birth and under age 5 mortality rates of 227 countries in
year 2002 and 2022 is used to examine the relationship between under age 5 mortality
rates and life expentancy at birth and how the data change over the years for diﬀerent
regions and subregions. Data from 2022 was examined to understand the relationship
between child mortality rate and life expectancy at birth and how the data vary between
male, female and diﬀerent regions. Also, the data from 2022 was compared with data
from 2002 to learn how these variables have change over time.

Firstly, Histogram is used to describe the frequency distribution of each of the variables
and the diﬀerences based on sexes and regions. To check if there are relationships
between the variables, correlation and scatter plots are used. Boxplot is used to visualise
if variables are homogenous within the subregions and heterogenous between diﬀerent
subregions. Boxplot is also used to check how the values of the variables have changed
over the years from 2002 to 2022.
